## What are options?

* An option is a contract that lets you trade on the future value of a particular financial asset.
* When you buy an option, you are paying a premium for the right to buy or sell the asset at a set price, on or before a set date when the option expires.

### How options work

There are two types of options: Calls and Puts.

* A ***call*** gives you the right, but no obligation, to buy an asset at a set price on or before a set date.
* A ***put*** gives you the right, but no obligation, to sell an asset at a set price on or before a set date.

* Buy a call option, and you take a long position on its underlying asset. The more the price rises, the more profit you can make and vice versa.

* Calls and puts both have an ***expiry date***. You don't have to buy or sell if the market doesn't move the way you expected, but once either option expires, it will become worthless. You ***lose*** the premium you paid for it, but nothing more.
* You could sell your option itself without ever exercising it - known as closing out - profiting from the price movement without committing a great deal of capital.
* If the market doesn't move in the way you expected, you don't have to exercise your option, limiting your losses to what you paid for the option itself.

### How options can generate a profit

* When you buy an option contract, you aren't physically buying anything - no asset is actually transferred.
* When you decide to exercise an option, on the grounds that doing so will earn you a profit, it gives you the right to buy the underlying asset from the option seller.

### Understanding the terms

* ***Holders and writers***: the buyer of an option is the holder, while the seller is the writer. In a call, the holder has the right to buy the underlying asset from the writer. In a put, the holder has the right to sell the underlying asset to the writer.
* ***Premium***: the fee paid by the holder to the writer for the option.
* ***Strike price***: the price at which the holder can buy or sell the underlying asset.
* ***Expiry***: the date and time when the options contract terminates. After expiry, the option is owrthless. If the underlying market doesn't hit the strike price before expiry, the holder can't earn a profit.
* ***In the money***: when the underlying market's price is above the strike or below the strike, meaning the holder can exercise the option and trade at a better price than the current market price.
* ***Out of the money***: when the underlying market's price is below the strike or above the strike, meaning that exercising the option will result in a loss.
* ***At the money***: when the underlying market's price is equal or very close to the strike.

### What does options trading cost?

* The cost of opening a position with IG includes an option premium and the dealing spread - the difference between the bid and ask price. The more likely it is that an option will move above or below the strike price, the higher its premium will tend to be.
* There will be no commission for CFD options - IG's only charge is the spread.

### How do options prices work?

* Options pricing is complicated and doesn't always move one-for-one with the underlying asset.

At IG option prices are set by the dealing desk, based on three key factors:

* ***The time to expiry*** - the longer an option has before it expires, the more time the underlying asset has to hit the strike price, so the premium will be higher.
* ***The current level of the underlying market*** - the closer the underlying asset is to the stirke price, the more likely it is to hit and pass the strike price.
* ***The volatility of the market*** - the more volatile the asset, the more likely it is that the option will hit its strike price. So options in a volatile market will see higher premiums.

## What are the benefits of trading options?

* If the market is rising, you can make money by buying an asset below the market with a call option.
* Alternatively, if the market is falling, a put option lets you sell an asset at a set price above the market.
* If the markets go flat, with many forms of trading there's not a lot you can do except hold on and hope things improve.

### Harnessing levverage

* Options enable you to trade using ***leverage***, meaning that the amount you pay to open is only a fraction of your trade's potential full value. This enables you to command a large position in a market with comparatively small payment.

### How are options used?

* ***Speculating with options***
* ***Hedging***: You could buy an option to sell the stock at a price that's close to its current level. Then if the stock's price falls, you can exericse your option and limit your losses. If your stock's price increases, then you have only lost the cost of buying the option in the first place.
* ***Profiting from volatility***

## How are options priced?

Some options are more expensive than others. Why is this?

* ***Underlying price***: Remember calls are right to buy, so sometimes the right to buy at the lower price is more desirable than the right to buy at the higher price, and so the value is greater.
* ***Time left to expiry***: The extra premium on top of the intrinsic value is called the ***time value***. The longer the time remaining to expiry, the greater the chance of further movements in the underlying asset and therefore the greater probability that the option may acquire intrinsic value.
* ***Option premium = intrinsic value + time value***: Options which have intrinsic value are described as being ***in the money***; Options which have no intrinsic value, and therefore only have time value, are described as being ***out of the money***; ***At the money*** is simply the option which has the closet strike price to the price of the underlying asset.
* ***Time decay***: the more time left to expiry, the more an option will cost. In other words, 
the time value of an option decays as the expiry draws closer, while the rate of decay increases as an option approaches expiry.
* ***Strike price***: At-the-money options will always have the greatest time value.
* *** Volatility***: If the volatility of security is high, there is a greater risk for an option writer, and they will demand higher premiums. If the volatility is low, the premiums required will be reduced.

### Interest rates and dividends

* The effect of changes in interest rates tends to be insignificant. Dividends paid out to shareholders by a company will cause the share price to drop by the amount of the dividend.
* Consequently, this will affect the price of options on that share.
* However, as the drop in share price is predictable, the impact of the fall will be priced into the premium well in advance.
