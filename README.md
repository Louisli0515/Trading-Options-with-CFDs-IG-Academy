## What are options?

* An option is a contract that lets you trade on the future value of a particular financial asset.
* When you buy an option, you are paying a premium for the right to buy or sell the asset at a set price, on or before a set date when the option expires.

### How options work

There are two types of options: Calls and Puts.

* A ***call*** gives you the right, but no obligation, to buy an asset at a set price on or before a set date.
* A ***put*** gives you the right, but no obligation, to sell an asset at a set price on or before a set date.

* Buy a call option, and you take a long position on its underlying asset. The more the price rises, the more profit you can make and vice versa.

* Calls and puts both have an ***expiry date***. You don't have to buy or sell if the market doesn't move the way you expected, but once either option expires, it will become worthless. You ***lose*** the premium you paid for it, but nothing more.
* You could sell your option itself without ever exercising it - known as closing out - profiting from the price movement without committing a great deal of capital.
* If the market doesn't move in the way you expected, you don't have to exercise your option, limiting your losses to what you paid for the option itself.

### How options can generate a profit

* When you buy an option contract, you aren't physically buying anything - no asset is actually transferred.
* When you decide to exercise an option, on the grounds that doing so will earn you a profit, it gives you the right to buy the underlying asset from the option seller.

### Understanding the terms

* ***Holders and writers***: the buyer of an option is the holder, while the seller is the writer. In a call, the holder has the right to buy the underlying asset from the writer. In a put, the holder has the right to sell the underlying asset to the writer.
* ***Premium***: the fee paid by the holder to the writer for the option.
* ***Strike price***: the price at which the holder can buy or sell the underlying asset.
* ***Expiry***: the date and time when the options contract terminates. After expiry, the option is owrthless. If the underlying market doesn't hit the strike price before expiry, the holder can't earn a profit.
* ***In the money***: when the underlying market's price is above the strike or below the strike, meaning the holder can exercise the option and trade at a better price than the current market price.
* ***Out of the money***: when the underlying market's price is below the strike or above the strike, meaning that exercising the option will result in a loss.
* ***At the money***: when the underlying market's price is equal or very close to the strike.

### What does options trading cost?

* The cost of opening a position with IG includes an option premium and the dealing spread - the difference between the bid and ask price. The more likely it is that an option will move above or below the strike price, the higher its premium will tend to be.
* There will be no commission for CFD options - IG's only charge is the spread.

### How do options prices work?

* Options pricing is complicated and doesn't always move one-for-one with the underlying asset.

At IG option prices are set by the dealing desk, based on three key factors:

* ***The time to expiry*** - the longer an option has before it expires, the more time the underlying asset has to hit the strike price, so the premium will be higher.
* ***The current level of the underlying market*** - the closer the underlying asset is to the stirke price, the more likely it is to hit and pass the strike price.
* ***The volatility of the market*** - the more volatile the asset, the more likely it is that the option will hit its strike price. So options in a volatile market will see higher premiums.
